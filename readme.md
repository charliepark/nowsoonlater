# Now/Soon/Later

## Hey, look. A to-do app.

Not going to try to oversell this one. It's simple and straightforward.

This is a to-do app, built in Sinatra. The premise is so simple it doesn't merit its own domain. You have one or more PROJECTS. Each project has three LEVELS OF URGENCY: Things to do NOW, things to do SOON, things to do LATER. Each of those levels of urgency has a bunch of TASKS.

You can add and remove tasks from your list. You can adjust the tasks up or down the urgency chain.

So that's the big idea. Tasks divided by how soon they need your attention.

Oh. Here's the fun bit. You only get ONE task in the "Now" column. You get FIVE in the "Soon" column. All the rest fall under "Later."

## Installation

If there's any real interest in this, I'm happy to set up a server and run this. For now, though, I'm going to let you have the code and run it on your own machine.

To run Now/Soon/Later, you need to have installed Sinatra and DataMapper on your machine. And, of course, Ruby. Just download the repository to your machine, cd into the directory, and run 'ruby nsl.rb'. That should do it.
